Hello, my name is Ashwin Mahendra Waghmare, and I am from Pune. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad, with a strong passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Over the past four years, I have gained substantial experience as a Software Developer, honing my skills in designing, installing, testing, and maintaining software systems. My expertise spans various platforms, programming languages, and embedded systems, and I am committed to delivering innovative solutions that push the boundaries of technology.

### My current pursuits in AI
##### **6G Semantic Communication**
Using deep learning in 6G semantic communication through neuro-symbolic AI combines the pattern recognition power of neural networks with the logical reasoning of symbolic AI. This approach enables the communication system to not only extract and transmit semantic information but also understand and reason the context and intent behind the data.

##### **Machine Learning for Raman Spectroscopy**
Machine learning for Raman spectroscopy of biomolecules streamlines the identification and analysis of biological compounds by automating spectral data interpretation. It enhances the detection of subtle biomolecular signatures, improves accuracy in classifying complex biological samples, and accelerates the discovery of biomarkers, aiding in research and diagnostics in biomedicine.

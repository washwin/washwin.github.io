Hello, my name is Ashwin Mahendra Waghmare, and I am from Pune. I have recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Dharwad and am currently pursuing an MBA at IIM Mumbai, specializing in General Management.

While my academic foundation lies in engineering, my professional aspirations are firmly rooted in management consulting. I am deeply passionate about solving complex business problems, driving strategic transformation, and delivering data-driven, high-impact solutions across industries. My prior experience as a Software Developer has equipped me with analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and technical adaptabilityâ€”skills I now seek to apply in broader business contexts.

At IIM Mumbai, I am actively engaging with coursework and projects in strategy, operations, and organizational behavior to deepen my understanding of business fundamentals. I am particularly drawn to consulting for its dynamic nature, exposure to diverse sectors, and the opportunity to create measurable value for clients. My goal is to build a career at the intersection of business strategy and data, helping organizations navigate uncertainty and scale sustainably.

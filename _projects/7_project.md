**Project Overview:**
In collaboration with Prof. Anand Konjengbam, this project focused on the development of language technology for the Lambani language—a tribal language with limited digital resources. The goal was to contribute to the preservation and digital representation of Lambani by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically utilizing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Through extensive data collection, model fine-tuning, and the application of advanced NLP methodologies, this project aimed to create language tools and resources that could bridge the technological gap for this underrepresented language.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Language Preservation and Digital Representation:** By focusing on the development of tools for Lambani, the project aimed to preserve the language in digital form and make it accessible for future generations. Digital representation of tribal languages like Lambani is essential for their survival in the modern, technology-driven world.

- **NLP Techniques (BERT):** The core of the project involved utilizing BERT for various NLP tasks such as text encoding, language modeling, and semantic understanding. BERT, being one of the most powerful transformer-based models for NLP, was fine-tuned on Lambani data to perform key tasks such as tokenization, text generation, and translation.
  
- **Data Collection and Web Scraping:** To build a comprehensive dataset for training NLP models, I conducted extensive data collection, gathering over 10 GB of linguistic data. This was achieved through web scraping, identifying digital texts, and assembling Lambani language materials. The vast dataset provided a rich foundation for the development of NLP models, expanding the scope for research and language technology development.

- **Text Analysis and Processing:** Detailed linguistic analysis was performed on the collected Lambani data to better understand the structure, semantics, and grammar of the language. Text analysis, along with preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, cleaning, and normalization, enabled the training of the BERT model with high accuracy.

- **Model Fine-Tuning:** The project involved fine-tuning BERT for Lambani, adjusting the pre-trained model to accommodate the nuances of the language. Fine-tuning was carried out to optimize the model’s performance for Lambani-specific tasks such as sentence completion, text generation, and entity recognition.

**Key Methodologies:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Leveraged state-of-the-art NLP methodologies to process Lambani texts. Techniques such as tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech tagging were tailored to handle Lambani’s unique linguistic properties.
  
- **BERT Model Customization:** Adapted BERT to handle the Lambani language by fine-tuning it on a custom dataset. The model was trained on linguistic data to capture the grammar, syntax, and semantic meanings of the language, thereby enhancing language understanding and representation.
  
- **Data Collection through Web Scraping:** Implemented automated scripts to scrape websites and digital repositories for Lambani texts. This process expanded the available linguistic data and provided a substantial dataset for the project’s research and development goals.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Limited Digital Resources:** Lambani, being a tribal language, had limited digital resources available. To overcome this, I conducted extensive web scraping and data collection efforts, gathering more than 10 GB of linguistic data, which significantly contributed to the dataset used for model training.
  
- **Model Fine-Tuning for Low-Resource Languages:** Fine-tuning BERT for a low-resource language like Lambani presented challenges, particularly in handling the nuances of the language. Customized tokenization and the use of specialized linguistic features helped improve the model’s understanding of Lambani.

**Technologies and Tools Used:**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Utilized BERT for Lambani language modeling and processing, adapting it to work effectively with the collected dataset.
- **Python and NLP Libraries:** Python was used to implement various NLP tasks, with libraries such as Hugging Face’s Transformers for fine-tuning BERT, NLTK, and spaCy for linguistic processing.
- **Web Scraping:** Employed web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to collect data from online sources.

**Impact:**
- **Preservation of a Tribal Language:** The project made a significant contribution to the digital preservation of the Lambani language, ensuring that it remains accessible for future generations in digital form.
- **Development of Language Tools:** By developing NLP tools for Lambani, this project opens up opportunities for further linguistic research and the creation of language resources such as text-to-speech systems, automatic translation, and educational materials.
- **Dataset Expansion:** The extensive data collection efforts have provided a valuable resource for ongoing and future research in Lambani language technology, offering a foundation for future NLP advancements in tribal and low-resource languages.

**Conclusion:**
This project represented a critical step towards the preservation and digital representation of the Lambani language using advanced NLP techniques. By collaborating with Prof. Anand Konjengbam and utilizing BERT for language technology development, I was able to contribute significantly to the creation of digital resources and language tools for Lambani, ensuring that this tribal language is not left behind in the era of digital transformation.

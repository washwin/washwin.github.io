This is a terminal-based Checkers game, featuring an AI bot powered by the Mini-Max Algorithm, designed to provide a challenging and competitive experience for players. The AI opponent is capable of making intelligent moves, simulating a realistic and dynamic game environment.

To enhance the AI's efficiency and effectiveness, I implemented the Alpha-Beta Pruning Method. This optimization technique significantly reduces the search space during decision-making, allowing the AI to explore only the most promising moves. As a result, the game maintains a high level of difficulty, ensuring that the AI opponent remains a formidable challenge for players, while also improving the overall responsiveness and speed of gameplay.

The Checkers game, playable entirely within the terminal, showcases a seamless blend of strategic gameplay and AI sophistication, offering an engaging experience for users seeking a competitive match against a smart, adaptive opponent.

This is a fully responsive bus booking website designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The website is meticulously crafted with a focus on intuitive navigation, allowing users to easily search for available buses, select their preferred options, and reserve tickets with minimal effort.

The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and accessible across various devices, ensuring that users can effortlessly browse and book tickets whether they're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. The streamlined design guides users through the booking process, from searching for routes and viewing schedules to selecting seats and confirming reservations, all within a few clicks.

To enhance functionality and ensure real-time data accuracy, I fully integrated the website with a PostgreSQL backend database. This integration manages and updates critical data, such as seat availability, bus schedules, and reservation details, in real time. Users can check the latest availability and make reservations.
